## Self Introduction
Hi, I am Xinyi Cao, you can also call me Celine. I am a graduate student majoring in transportation engineering. I am interested in public transportation planning and design, and I am eager to dedicate myself to creating more better transit-friendly communities.
## Goals and objectives
I have used Python and C to analyze data before, but I still need to improve programming abilities and learn how to use these tools to solve the problems.
In this class, I want to learn how to draw the demographics geographical pictures, which can help me analyze the travel demand in a certain area. I believe it will be very helpful for my future study.
